# Better for the Environment
Proof of Stake Blockchains use far less power compaired to their Proof of work counterparts. Combining the Adamant api with a protocol that verifies the transaction record on personal devices rather than multiple network nodes allows for far greener experience.

# Cheaper Gas Fees
By having your machine run the smart contract for the NFTs it allows for far cheaper gas fees in the cryptocurrency you use. In the case of most tokens the average gas fee of 200 $ in Ether shrinks to 20 $.

# Cross Chain Transactions
Our protocol allows for any blockchain network to be added with the right api though at the moment we are focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge, Dash and Arweave

# Verifiable artists
Working with artists we can verify their identity though social media and the use of Premium NFTs. Stolen art is a horrible side to NFTs and you won't have to worry about that with our verified options.
