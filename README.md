# Bridge-Market
Hello and welcome to Bridge-Market<br>
Bridge Market is hoping to build NFTs on the Adamant blockchain
<hr>

NFTs are minted as key value pairs on the Adamant network
```
[name]: [url]
```


They are transfered when the current owner pushes a transaction message to the network


```
[name]| : [newOwner]|[currency]|[amount]|[Address from]|[Adress to]
```



Bids are messages sent to the current owner that are unencrypted in the form


```
[name]@|[amount]|[currency]|[address]
```


The owner can send a confirm message during the transfer of the NFT but if they do not the NFT will be transferred after an our if the amount of currency is confirmed from the [Address from] to the [Addsress to] after that hour.

Premium NFTs are stored on Arweave to avoid people taking down the images after the NFT is minted using arweave js.

Currently accepts

Ethereum, Arweave, Bitcoin, Adamant, Dash and Doge transactions
